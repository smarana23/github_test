Communication Prompt for Stakeholders/Developers
"I'm developing a professional website for RDR Software Solutions that comprehensively showcases our diverse service portfolio and company information. The website will be built using React Vite and Tailwind CSS, emphasizing responsive design and interactive user experience.
Our website will feature five main sections: Home, Services, Company, Careers, and Contact Us. The Services section is particularly crucial as it will contain dedicated pages for our ten distinct service offerings, ranging from Academic Excellence to Payroll Management. Each service page will clearly explain how we help clients achieve their specific goals through that particular service.
The Company page will communicate our values and methodology through three sections: About Us, How We Work, and Why Choose Us. We'll also feature a Careers page to attract talent and showcase our company culture. The Contact page will include a user-friendly form for visitor inquiries.
I want to incorporate modern interactive elements such as dynamic card transitions and hover effects to enhance engagement. The design should be professional yet innovative, reflecting our technical expertise while ensuring accessibility across all devices.
Through this website, we aim to clearly communicate how RDR Software Solutions helps clients reach their goals through our comprehensive service offerings. Each service description should emphasize the specific benefits and outcomes clients can expect when partnering with us.
I need detailed guidance on the folder structure, necessary indexing, and all commands required for installation and execution of this React Vite project with Tailwind CSS integration."
